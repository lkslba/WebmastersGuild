I've been creating websites since the early 2000s and have a passion for clean, minimal designs with a focus on content. My current site features tutorials on terminal applications, custom CSS experiments, and the occasional tech opinion piece.

I believe in the importance of personal websites as a way to share knowledge and express creativity outside the walled gardens of social media. The WebmastersGuild community has been a great source of inspiration and feedback.

My coding interests include:
- Frontend development
- Terminal applications
- Static site generators
- Web accessibility

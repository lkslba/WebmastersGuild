      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating websites since the early 2000s and have a passion for clean, minimal designs with a focus on content. My current site features tutorials on terminal applications, custom CSS experiments, and the occasional tech opinion piece.
I believe in the importance of personal websites as a way to share knowledge and express creativity outside the walled gardens of social media. The WebmastersGuild community has been a great source of inspiration and feedback.</description>
